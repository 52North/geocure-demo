# Geocure REST API Demo

A demo client showcasing how to use [52° North's Geocure REST API](https://github.com/52North/geocure).

Just open the `index.html` in a browser and you should be ready to go. Connects to 52° North's [dev instance of the API](http://colabis.dev.52north.org/geocure/services), which pipes data from the COLABIS [WMS](https://geoserver.colabis.de/geoserver/ows?Service=WMS&Request=GetCapabilities) and [WFS](https://geoserver.colabis.de/geoserver/ows?Service=WFS&Request=GetCapabilities) services.
